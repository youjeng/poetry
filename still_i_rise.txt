# Still I Rise

## Verse 1
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

## Verse 2
Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

## Verse 3
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.
